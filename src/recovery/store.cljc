(ns recovery.store
  "SSoT for the materials-recovery actor, behind a `Store` protocol so
  the backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same seam every prior
  `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses:

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see langchain.kotoba-db).

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/recovery/store_contract_test.clj), which is the whole point:
  the actor, the Traceability Governor and the audit ledger never know
  which SSoT they run on.

  Like `aerospace.store`'s dual assembly-dispatch/airworthiness-
  evidence history and every other dual-actuation sibling before it,
  this actor has TWO actuation events (certifying a material grade,
  publishing an impact report) acting on the SAME entity (a batch),
  each with its OWN history collection, sequence counter and dedicated
  double-actuation-guard boolean (`:material-grade-certified?`/
  `:impact-report-published?`, never a `:status` value) -- the same
  discipline every prior sibling governor's guards establish, informed
  by `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s status-lifecycle bug
  (ADR-2607071320).

  The ledger stays append-only on every backend: 'which batch was
  screened for an unresolved contamination flag, which grade was
  certified, which impact report was published, on what jurisdictional
  basis, approved by whom' is always a query over an immutable log --
  the audit trail a community trusting a materials-recovery operator
  needs, and the evidence an operator needs if a grade-certification
  or impact-report decision is later disputed."
