(ns recovery.operation
  "OperationActor -- one materials-recovery operation = one supervised
  actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The advisor
  (Recovery Advisor) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its
  proposal is ALWAYS routed through the Traceability Governor
  (:govern) and the rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything
  commits to the SSoT.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore today; Datomic/kotoba-server is the next seam) - `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)                                       - :advisor opt
    - the Phase    (0->3 rollout)                                          - :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one materials-recovery operation (intake -> advise
  -> govern -> decide -> commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner
  loop -- each operation is auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human operator (the materials-recovery operator). The
  approver resumes with `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or
  :rejected). `:actuation/certify-material-grade`/`:actuation/publish-
  impact-report` ALWAYS reach this node when the governor is clean --
  see `recovery.phase`."
