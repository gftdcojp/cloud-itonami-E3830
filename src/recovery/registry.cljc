  "Pure-function material-grade-certification + impact-report record
  construction -- an append-only materials-recovery-operator book-of-
  record draft.

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single
  international check-digit standard for a material-grade-
  certification or impact-report reference number -- every operator/
  jurisdiction assigns its own reference format. This namespace does
  NOT invent one; it builds a jurisdiction-scoped sequence number and
  validates the record's required fields, the same honest, non-
  fabricating discipline `recovery.facts` uses.

  `contamination-percentage-exceeds-maximum?` is the FOURTH instance
  of this fleet's MAXIMUM-ceiling check family (`facility.registry/
  occupancy-exceeds-capacity?` established the first, `school.
  registry/class-size-exceeds-maximum?` the second, `card.registry/
  settlement-amount-exceeds-authorized?` the third), applying the SAME
  single-value-vs-ceiling-comparison shape to a batch's own measured
  contamination percentage against the batch's own recorded maximum-
  allowed-for-grade threshold.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real scale/scanner/MRF (materials recovery facility)
  control system. It builds the RECORD an operator would keep, not
  the act of certifying the material grade or publishing the impact
  report itself (that is `recovery.operation`'s `:actuation/certify-
  material-grade`/`:actuation/publish-impact-report`, always human-
  gated -- see README `Actuation`)."
