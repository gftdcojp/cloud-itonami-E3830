  "Traceability Governor -- the independent compliance layer that
  earns the Recovery Advisor the right to commit. The LLM has no
  notion of materials-recovery grading law, whether a batch's own
  measured contamination percentage actually stays within its own
  recorded maximum-allowed ceiling, whether a contamination flag
  against the batch has actually stayed unresolved, or when an act
  stops being a draft and becomes a real-world material-grade
  certification or impact-report publication, so this MUST be a
  separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD --
  the materials-recovery-operator analog of `cloud-itonami-isic-6512`'s
  CasualtyGovernor.

  Six checks, in priority order, ALL HARD violations: a human approver
  CANNOT override them (you don't get to approve your way past a
  fabricated grading-standard spec-basis, incomplete evidence, an
  over-contaminated batch, an unresolved contamination flag, or a
  double certification/publication). The confidence/actuation gate is
  SOFT: it asks a human to look (low confidence / actuation), and the
  human may approve -- but see `recovery.phase`: for `:stake
  :actuation/certify-material-grade`/`:actuation/publish-impact-report`
  (a real economic/ESG claim) NO phase ever allows auto-commit either.
  Two independent layers agree that actuation is always a human call.

    1. Spec-basis                  -- did the grading proposal cite an
                                       OFFICIAL source (`recovery.
                                       facts`), or invent one?
    2. Evidence incomplete         -- for `:actuation/certify-
                                       material-grade`/`:actuation/
                                       publish-impact-report`, has the
                                       batch actually been graded with
                                       a full weight/scale-record/
                                       material-composition-scan-
                                       record/contamination-inspection-
                                       record/buyer-specification-

                                       on file?
    3. Contamination exceeds
       maximum                       -- for `:actuation/certify-
                                       material-grade`, INDEPENDENTLY
                                       recompute whether the batch's
                                       own contamination percentage
                                       exceeds its own recorded
                                       maximum-allowed-for-grade
                                       ceiling (`recovery.registry/
                                       contamination-percentage-
                                       exceeds-maximum?`) -- needs no
                                       proposal inspection or stored-
                                       verdict lookup at all. The

    4. Contamination flag unresolved -- reported by THIS proposal itself
                                       (a `:contamination/screen` that
                                       just found an unresolved flag),
                                       or already on file for the
                                       batch (`:contamination/screen`/
                                       `:actuation/publish-impact-

                                       UNCONDITIONALLY (not scoped to a
                                       specific op), the SAME
                                       discipline `casualty.governor/
                                       sanctions-violations`/...
                                       (twenty-seven prior siblings)...
                                       established -- the TWENTY-
                                       EIGHTH distinct application of
                                       this exact discipline, and the
                                       FIRST specifically for a
                                       contamination-flag concept.
                                       Like the seventeen most recent
                                       siblings' equivalent checks,
                                       this is exercised in tests/demo
                                       via `:contamination/screen`
                                       DIRECTLY, not via an actuation
                                       op against an unscreened batch
                                       -- see this ns's own test suite.
    5. Confidence floor / actuation
       gate                          -- LLM confidence below threshold,
                                       OR the op is `:actuation/
                                       certify-material-grade`/
                                       `:actuation/publish-impact-
                                       report` (REAL economic/ESG
                                       claims) -> escalate.

  Two more guards, double-certification/double-publication
  prevention, are enforced but NOT listed as numbered HARD checks
  above because they need no upstream comparison at all --
  `already-certified-violations`/`already-published-violations` refuse
  to certify a grade/publish a report for the SAME batch twice, off
  dedicated `:material-grade-certified?`/`:impact-report-published?`
  facts (never a `:status` value) -- the SAME 'check a dedicated
  boolean, not status' discipline every prior sibling governor's
  guards establish, informed by `cloud-itonami-isic-6492`'s status-
  lifecycle bug (ADR-2607071320)."
